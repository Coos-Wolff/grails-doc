DomainClassUnitTestMixin Basics

DomainClassUnitTestMixin is typically used in combination with testing either a controller, service or tag library where the domain is a mock collaborator defined by the Mock annotation:

import grails.test.mixin.TestFor
import grails.test.mixin.Mock
import spock.lang.Specification
@TestFor(BookController)
@Mock(Book)
class BookControllerSpec extends Specification {
    // â€¦
